# Left-Handed vs Right-Handed Age at Death Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the difference in average age at death between left-handed and right-handed individuals. It investigates whether the commonly believed claim that left-handed people die younger is genuinely true or a result of historical and societal trends.

The analysis uses age distribution data and probability-based methods to understand how changing rates of left-handedness over time influence observed lifespan differences.

---

## Objective
- Analyze age-at-death differences between left-handers and right-handers  
- Examine the effect of historical trends on left-handedness  
- Apply probability and Bayesian methods to validate claims  
- Visualize mortality distributions across age groups  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Bayesian Statistics  

---

## Methodology
- Loaded and cleaned handedness and mortality datasets  
- Calculated birth years and mean handedness trends  
- Applied conditional probability and Bayesian analysis  
- Compared age-at-death probabilities for left- and right-handers  
- Visualized mortality distributions using plots  

---

## Key Findings
- Left-handed individuals are underrepresented in older age groups  
- Historical societal bias reduced reported left-handedness in earlier generations  
- Observed lifespan differences are influenced by demographic and cultural factors  
- The belief that left-handers die earlier is largely a statistical artifact  

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates that differences in average age at death between left- and right-handed individuals are not purely biological. Instead, they are strongly influenced by historical reporting trends and societal factors. Data analytics and probability-based analysis help challenge common misconceptions using evidence.
